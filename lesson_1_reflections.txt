How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

	Made it easy to check lines different between the two files, but still hard to find where exactly is different.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

	I can go back to anytime of history and start from just that point, which saves much of my time and effort.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

	pros: can make reasonable history, not too small or not too big.
	cons: tedious, easy to forget to commit.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

	Because those multiple files are interrelated so it needs to be treated together at one time.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

	"git log" to view the history, and "git diff" to see the difference between two commits.
