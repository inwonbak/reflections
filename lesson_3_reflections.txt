When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When developing a project with other programmers.
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Local repository should not necessarily be up-to-date with remote repository. For example, I might want to do something experimental without getting affected from remote repository.
